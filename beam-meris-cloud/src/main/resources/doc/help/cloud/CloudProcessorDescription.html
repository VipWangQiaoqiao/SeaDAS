<p class="inote">Please note: The chapter <i><a href="../processors/ProcessorCommons.html">BEAM Scientific Data Processors</a></i>
    provides a general description for all BEAM data processors. It describes the common graphical user interface (GUI),
    the command-line interface and the common processing request file format.</p>

<h3>The Cloud Probability Processing Request File</h3>

<p>The following table describes
    the Cloud Probability processor specific processing request file contents. For a detailed description of the
    processing request file concept and file specification please look at chapter
    <i><a href="../processors/ProcessorCommons#ProcessingRequestConcept">Processing Request Files</a></i>.</p>

<table width="100%">
    <tr>
        <th>Parameter name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Valueset</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>type</td>
        <td>Request type. Mandatory attribute of the <code>Request</code> element</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>"MER_L2_CLOUD"</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Advanced configuration</h3>

<p>The algorithm uses two different neural nets. The first for usage over land and the second for usage
 over the open ocean. By default every pixel which altitude is below -50m is treated as ocean.</p>
 <p>This selection can be edited in the config files, which together with the neural nets are unpacked 
 into a subdirectory of the user directory. The subdirectory used is 
 <code>.beam/cloud-probability-processor/auxdata</code>
 The file <code>cloud_config.txt</code> specifies which configuration for the land and the ocean case are used.
 In the respective configuration files following properties are of interest:
 <ul>
 	<li>The property <code>neural_net</code> specifies the filename of the neural net to use.</li>
 	<li>The property <code>validExpression</code> gives a boolean expression,
	which is used to select between the land and the ocean net.<br/>
	First the validExpression for land is evaluated and if <code>true</code> the land net is used.
	As a second option the expression for the ocean net is evaluated.
	If neither of the two expressions evaluate to true, the no-data value is set.
	</li>
 </ul>
