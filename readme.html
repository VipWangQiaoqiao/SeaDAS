<h1>About BEAM 4</h1>

<hr/>

<a name="into"/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The BEAM software is a set of executable tools and an application
    programming interface (API) facilitating the use
    of the data products of a number of earth observation satellites.
    BEAM has initially been developed to support the
    data of the MERIS, AATSR and ASAR sensors onboard the ESA Envisat platform.
    BEAM is developed under contract to
    <a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESRIN_SITE/">ESA/ESRIN</a>.</p>

<p>You can submit BEAM bug reports and feature request to the
    <a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam-jira/browse/BEAM">BEAM issue tracker</a>.</p>

<a name="directory"/>

<h2>Directory Structure</h2>

<p>This is the structure of the BEAM installation directory:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code><a href="bin">bin</a></code> - BEAM/VISAT executable and BEAM command-line tools.</li>
    <li><code><a href="config">config</a></code> - BEAM configuration file.</li>
    <li><code><a href="lib">lib</a></code> - Common libraries used by BEAM.</li>
    <li><code><a href="modules">modules</a></code> - Installed BEAM modules and plugins.</li>
    <li><code><a href="licenses">licenses</a></code> - 3rd party licenses and EULAs of libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>If BEAM is started the first time, a <code>.beam</code> directory is created in the user's
    home directory. BEAM uses this directory to store user preferences, auxiliary and temporary data.</p>

<a name="tpcontent"/>

<h2>Third Party Content</h2>

<p>BEAM includes some items that have been sourced from third parties. The licenses for these items
    are provided in the <code>licenses</code> directory (see above). Especially an
    open-source license of the <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/">JIDE Java and Swing Components Library</a>
    has kindly been made available for the BEAM project. These are distributed under
    the <a href="licenses/jide_eula.html">JIDE EULA</a> and may only be used indirectly in the context
    of BEAM.</p>
