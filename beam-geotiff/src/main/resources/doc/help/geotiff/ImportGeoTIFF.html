<h3>Import GeoTIFF</h3>

<p>This command allows to import the data of a GeoTIFF file.</p>

<p>GeoTIFF is an extension to the TIFF 6.0 specification. These image files contain
    additional information about thier georeference and their spatial resolution. A wide range of
    projected coordinate systems are supported including UTM, US State Plane, and National Grids.
    For further information have a look at the following documentations:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/geotiff.html">GeoTIFF Homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html">TIFF Specification</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints of reading GeoTIFF product files</h3>

<p>If an GeoTiff file was exported by BEAM, the reader can recover information from a special tag
    used by the <a href="ExportGeoTIFF.html">GeoTIFF writer</a>.<br/>
    This includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name and type of the product.</li>
    <li>Name, description and unit of each band.</li>
    <li>The properties of no-data and scaling for each band.</li>
    <li>The index coding of a band.</li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands.</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For features and limitations of the GeoTIFF import and constraints see the following list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only the first image of a GeoTIFF file is considered.</li>
    <li>The size of images is limited to a pixel count of 2<sup>32</sup>.</li>
    <li>The GeoTIFF reader supports the projections available in BEAM,
       model transformations and tie-points.</li>
    <li>Color maps are considered and converted to an index coding.</li>
</ul>
