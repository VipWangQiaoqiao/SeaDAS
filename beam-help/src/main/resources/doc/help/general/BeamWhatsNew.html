<h3>BEAM Version 4.11</h3>

<p>BEAM 4.11 is a release featuring lots of new tools.<br>
    The Time Series Tools has been included into BEAM, which allows users to create, inspect, and analyse time series of EO data.
    The new Temporal Percentile Operator has been introduced; it allows users to create multiple kinds of gap-filled percentile computations.
    The old binning has been replaced by a new one which adds a number of useful functions and aggregation methods. It is now possible to download
    data witihn BEAM using
    the novel OPeNDAP client which provides an easy interface to arbitrary OPeNDAP servers.<br>
    BEAM 4.11 now allows to write NetCDF-4 data.
    Some outdated parts of the software have been dropped in order to keep it lean, such as the former mosaic processor,
    which has been fully replaced by a faster, more modern variant. Additionally, many changes in the API have been made
    that allow users to even better develop software on basis of BEAM.</p>

</ul>

<hr>
<h5>BEAM 4.8</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Readers</b> for <a href="../visat/ImportSpotVgt.html">SPOT VEGETATION</a> products,
        <a href="../visat/ImportLandsat.html">Landsat TM</a> products in GeoTIFF format,
        <a href="../visat/ImportNetCDF.html">gridded HDF-EOS</a> products, and generic <a
                href="../visat/ImportNetCDF.html">NetCDF/CF</a>-products have been added..
    </li>
    <li>
        A <b>writer</b> for generic <a href="../visat/ExportNetCdfProduct.html">NetCDF/CF</a>-products has been added.
    </li>
    <li>
        The possibility to apply <b>auto-grouping</b> in the product tree has benn added; that is, product
        nodes whose names begin equally are automatically put into a common group.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <a href="../visat/Toolbars.html">toolbar button</a> has been added to <b>show a world map overlay</b>
        on geographic lat/lon projected products.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ESA GlobCover Land Cover Map is used as default world map layer now; however, it is still possible to choose
        the
        NASA Blue Marble as world map layer instead.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h5>BEAM 4.7</h5>
<ul>
    <li>VISAT now provides a <a href="../visat/VectorDataManagement.html">Vector Data Management</a> allowing users
        to <b>draw and manipulate geometries</b> (vector data) or to import them from <b>ESRI Shapefiles</b>.
        Geometries are now an integral part of the BEAM data model.
    </li>
    <li>The VISAT <a href="../visat/MaskManagement.html">Mask and ROI Management</a> has been revised completely.
        Any number of raster data masks can be defined by <b>band maths expressions</b>, <b>value ranges</b> and
        <b>existing geometries</b>. Each mask can serve as a <b>region of interest (ROI)</b> for raster data analysis.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a>, <a
            href="../visat/HistogramDialog.html">Histogram</a>,
        and <a href="../visat/DensityPlotDialog.html">Scatter Plot</a> tool windows have been enhanced in order to <b>support
            the
            new, named ROIs</b>.
        The <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a> tool window can now operate on <b>multiple ROIs</b>.
    </li>
    <li>The
        <a href="../visat/Reprojection.html">Reprojection</a> (formerly 'Map Projection'),
        <a href="../visat/Mosaic.html">Mosaicing</a> and
        <a href="../visat/Orthorectification.html">Orthorectification</a> processors have been redesigned from scratch.
        Due to the great <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">GeoTools</a> library, BEAM now offers more than
        <b>100 predefined, map projections</b> based on their <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG</a>
        codes. For user-defined map projections you can now select from 25 map projection
        transformations and more than 100 geodetic datums. Since the new Reprojection, Mosaicing and
        Orthorectification processors are developed using the <b>BEAM Graph Processing Framework</b> (GPF), they now
        offer a <b>powerful command-line</b> and can be used in any GPF XML <b>processing graph</b> for, e.g., pre-
        and post-processing.
        Finally, the <b>runtime performance</b> of this tools has been drastically improved.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/NavigationWindow.html">Navigation</a> tool window has been improved. It is now feasible
        to display a <b>synchronized pixel cursor</b> in all image views.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/WorldMap.html">World Map</a> tool window has been completely revised. It now uses a
        <b>higher-resolution RGB</b> (NASA Blue Marble) in which you can easily pan and zoom in and out.
    </li>
</ul>
