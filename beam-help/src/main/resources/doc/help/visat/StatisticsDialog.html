<h3>Statistics Display</h3>

<p>The statistics dialog, opened via <img src="images/icons/Statistics24.gif">, displays statistical information about the currently
    selected band. See the screenshot for an example.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <img src="images/StatisticsDialog.png">
</blockquote>

The set of statistical information displayed comprises:
<ul>
    <li>the total number of pixels</li>
    <li>the minimum/maximum geophysical value</li>
    <li>the mean geophysical value and its standard deviation (sigma)</li>
    <li>the median geophysical value</li>
    <li>several percentile thresholds</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Additionally, two diagrams are displayed: the left one is a histogram, the right one shows the thresholds for all
    percentiles.<br>
    The statistics can be computed for a whole band, or the considered pixels can be restricted to those matching a
    single or multiple ROI masks. The list of masks can be narrowed down by typing a pattern into the text field. For
    convenience, there is also the <img src="images/icons/MaskManager24.png">-icon which allows the user to open the
    <a href="MaskManagement.html">mask manager tool window.</a>
</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Note:</b> A mouse right-click within the statistics tables
    brings up a context menu with the item <i>Copy data to clipboard</i>.
    This will copy the diagram data as tabulated text to the system clipboard.
    The copied text can then be pasted directly into a spreadsheet application
    (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel).
