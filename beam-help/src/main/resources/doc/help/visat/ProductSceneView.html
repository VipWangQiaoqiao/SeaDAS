<h3>Image View</h3>

<p>
    The image view displays the sample values of raster datasets such as bands and tie-point grids as an image.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
    In VISAT 4.5, the display of prodcut scene images has been enhanced.<br>
    The view uses tiled images and image pyramids, this results in greatly improved image display performance
    and memory usage.<br/>
    Additionally the view is enhanced with a navigation control which can be used to to pan, zoom and rotate the
    image.
</p>

<h4><a name="sliderBar"/>Slider Bar</h4>

<p>
    By default the horizontal and vertical slider bars are disabled for the image view.
    You can activate the sliders again in the preferences dialog in the section
    <a href="PreferencesDialog.html#layerproperties">Layer Properties</a>.<br/>
    If the slider bars are visible you have also a small button <img src="images/icons/ZoomAll13.gif"> in the
    lower right corner of the image view which zooms to the fill image bounds if you click on it
</p>

<h4><a name="navControl"/>Navigation Control</h4>

<p>
    The navigation control, which is located in the upper left corner of the image view, can be used to
    pan, zoom and rotate the image. The visibility of the control is dimmed if the mouse pointer is not
    located over the and it becomes visible when the mouse gets near the control.<br/>
    If you rotate the image, you can use the <b>CTRL</b>-Key to change the stepping of the rotation angle from
    continuous values to a discrete stepping of quarter of 90&deg;.<br/>
    The left image shows the dimmed version of the control the right one shows the active control with a rotation.
    You can deactivate the navigation control in the preferences dialog in the section <a
        href="PreferencesDialog.html#layerproperties">Layer Properties</a>
</p>

<h4>Multiple Windows of the same band</h4>

<p>It is possible to open more than one window of the same band to have several views. This can be done
    by selecting <b>Open Image View</b> from the context menu of the band name in the <b>Product Tree</b>.
    The will open a new view and will be numbered according to their appearance:</p>
