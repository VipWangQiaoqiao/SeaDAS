<h4><a name="productView"/>Product View</h4>

<p>If you create a new, open or import an existing data product, VISAT will put it into it's
    open product list. The product list is a tree view with up to four root nodes for each open product:
<ul>
    <li>Bands - contains all measured spectral/geophysical and quality raster datasets of a product (mandatory)</li>
    <li>Geometries - contains all geometries of a product: pins, ground control points (GCPs), lines, polylines,
        rectangles, ellipses, and polygons (optional)</li>
    <li>Tie-point grids - contains all tie-point grid raster datasets (optional)</li>
    <li>Flag Codings - contains flag coding metadata for quality flags datasets (optional)</li>
    <li>Index Codings - contains index coding metadata for classification bands (optional)</li>
    <li>Metadata - contains additional metadata (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can quickly open an <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a> for a
    band or tie-point grid by double-clicking on an item of the expanded product root nodes.
    Accordingly a metadata view is opened if you click an item the flag coding or metadata nodes.
    Please also refer to the <a href="NavigationWindow.html">Navigation Window</a> and the
    the <a href="Toolbars.html#zoomtool">Zoom</a> and <a href="Toolbars.html#pannertool">Panner</a>
    tools.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/VisatOverview.jpg"></p>

<p>The information concerning each pixel can be analysed interactively in the
    pixel information view.</p>

<br>

<h4><a name="pixelView"/>Pixel Info View</h4>

<p>If you click on the tab 'Pixel View' on the left side of the VISAT window,
    pixel information will be displayed while you move the mouse over the band image
    view.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/PixelView.png"></p>

<p>You can un-dock each frame using the floating-button (<img src="images/icons/FloatingButton.gif" border=0>),
    and dock it back to the Pixel View by using the close-button (<img src="images/icons/ClosingButton.png" border=0>)
    in the header bar. If it is already docked and the close-button is used the corresponding frame is hidden.
    In floating mode the docking-button (<img src="images/icons/DockingButton.gif" border=0>) lets the window dock to
    the main frame of VISAT as any other tool view.
</p>
<p>
    The buttons at the bottom of the Pixel View switch the visibility state of the corresponding frame, regardless if
    its currently floating or docked.
</p>

<p>The informations displayed belong to the current image pixel beneath the mouse pointer:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Geo-location:</b><br>
        Displays the image position, the geographic-location and also the map co-ordinates if the current
        product is map-projected.
    </li>
    <li><b>Tie Point Grids:</b><br>
        Shows the values of the tie-point grids.
    </li>
    <li><b>Time Info:</b><br>
        The time information associated with the current line.
    </li>
    <li><b>Bands:</b><br>
        The value of the pixel beneath the mouse pointer.
    </li>
    <li><b>Flags:</b><br>
        Displayes the state of the flags at the current pixel.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If a pin is selected in the current image view you can select <b>Snap to selected pin</b>
    in order to "freeze" the pixel info to the position of the currently selected pin.
</p>

<p class="inote">Note: In the <a href="PreferencesDialog.html">Preferences Dialog</a> you can deselect the
    option that only pixel values of displayed bands are shown.</p>
