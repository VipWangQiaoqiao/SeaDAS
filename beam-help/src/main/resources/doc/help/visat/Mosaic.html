<h4>Variables & Conditions</h4>
<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width:0;" valign="top">
            <h5>Variables</h5>

            <p class="i1">Defines the list of output variables. <br>
                A variable is composed of a name and a data source expression.
                The expression can be composed of mathematical operators, functions and symbols referencing the flags
                and bands defined in the input products, e.g. <code>"0.5 * (radiance_11 + radiance_13)"</code> or
                even boolean expressions such as <code>"(radiance_13 > 50.0) AND NOT l1_flags.INVALID"</code>.
                By double-clicking into the expression field you can open the BEAM expression editor.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/Copy24.gif"> Add a band directly as variable.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/Plus24.gif"> Add a new variable.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/Minus24.gif"> Removes the currently selected variable from the list.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/MoveUp24.gif"> Moves the currently selected variable one line up.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/MoveDown24.gif"> Moves the currently selected variable one line down..<br>
            </p>
            <h5>Conditions</h5>

            <p class="i1">Defines the list of valid pixel conditions. <br>
                A condition is composed of a name and a test expression.
                The boolean test expression can be composed of mathematical operators, functions and symbols referencing
                the flags and bands defined in the input products, e.g. <code>"(radiance_13 > 50.0) AND NOT
                    l1_flags.INVALID"</code>.
                By double-clicking into the expression field you can open the BEAM expression editor. By selecting the
                'Outp.' toggle you can output the number of times a condition returned "true" for an output product
                pixel.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/Plus24.gif"> Add a new condition.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/Minus24.gif"> Removes the currently selected condition from the list.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/MoveUp24.gif"> Moves the currently selected condition one line up.<br>
                <img src="images/icons/MoveDown24.gif"> Moves the currently selected condition one line down..<br>
            <p class="i1">
                <b>Combine:</b>
                If more than one valid pixel condition is given, they are combined using the
                condition operator which can take the values <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>. If the value is <code>AND</code>
                all criteria must be fulfilled to consider a given pixel in the output product.</p>
