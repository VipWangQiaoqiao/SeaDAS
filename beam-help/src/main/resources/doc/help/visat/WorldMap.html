<p>When working with satellite data, it is often not obvious at first sight which
    region of the world is covered by the data product. To facilitate finding the
    location of the product on Earth, VISAT provides a World Map tool window which
    displays the product boundary on a Plate Carr&eacute;e map.</p>

<p><img src="images/icons/WorldMap24.gif"> To invoke the World Map simply click on the globe icon in the <a href="Toolbars.html">main
    toolbar</a> or select <b>World Map</b> from the <a href="ViewMenu.html">'View --> Tool Windows'</a> sub-menu.
    This will open the tool window shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/WorldMap.png"></p>

<p>To zoom in and out, simply use the mouse wheel. <br/>
   <img src="images/WorldMapButtons.png"><br/>
    To zoom to the currently selected product use the button on the right side.<br/>
    The button on the left side zooms out to display the whole world.

    obtained at <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/">http://visibleearth.nasa.gov</a>.
