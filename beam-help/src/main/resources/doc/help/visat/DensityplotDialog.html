<h3>Scatter Plot Display</h3>

<p>
    This dialog allows you to plot one variable against another.<br>
    For each band, the value range is evenly divided into 512 bins.
    The scatter plot shows these bins plotted against each other, resulting in 512*512 cells.
    For each cell, the number of pixels within the according bands' value ranges is counted and color coded.
    Yellow stands for large amounts of pixels, black for small ones.
    If no pixel is assigned to a distinct cell, the cell will receive no color.
    You can toggle the color coding with the 'Invert plot colors' checkbox.<br>
    The scatter plot will be computed when you hit <img src="images/icons/ViewRefresh22.png">.

<h4>Options Panel</h4>

<p>
    The outcome of the scatter plot can be altered via the options in the options panel.
    Note that the scatter plot needs to be recomputed in order for changes to the option panel to take effect.
</p>

<ul>

    <li><b>Refresh View <img src="images/icons/ViewRefresh22.png"></b><br>
        Causes the scatter plot to be (re-)computed.
        The button is only enabled when a computation is expected to lead to a different scatter plot than the one on display.
    </li>

    <li><b>Collapse/Expand Options Panel <img src="images/icons/PanelRight12.png" border="1" > / <img src="images/icons/PanelLeft12.png" border="1"></b><br>
        Collapses or expands the options panel.
    </li>

    <li><b>ROI Mask</b><br>
        A ROI mask may be used to mask out values. All values which do not match the mask are not taken
        into account. For convenience, the mask manager may be openened from the scatter plot window using the
        <img src="images/icons/MaskManager24.png">-button.<br>
        For creating a ROI mask from the scatter plot, see 'Select Mask 'scatter_plot_area'' from the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Auto min/max</b><br>
        For both bands, you can explicitly set the minimum and maximum values to be considered during the computation
        of the scatter plot.
        To do so, disable the checkbox for the respective band and enter the desired min- or max-value.
        When the checkboxes are enabled, min- and max-values will be determined automatically.
    </li>

    <li><b>Invert plot colors</b><br>
        Inverts the color range. When selected, large pixel frequencies will be displayed in black, small ones in
        yellow.
    </li>

    <li><b>Zoom all <img src="images/icons/View-Fullscreen22.png"></b><br>
        Adjusts both axes to the full data range.
        You can also use the 'Auto range' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Edit Properties <img src="images/icons/Edit24.gif"></b><br>
        Edit several properties (colors, axes, etc.) of the diagram.
        You can also use the 'Properties...' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Save chart as image <img src="images/icons/Export24.gif"></b><br>
        Save the diagram as image (PNG).
        You can also use the 'Save as...' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Print chart <img src="images/icons/Print24.gif"></b><br>
        Print the diagram.
        You can also use the 'Print...' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Help <img src="images/icons/Help22.png"></b><br>
        Displays this page.
    </li>

</ul>

<h4>Context Menu</h4>

<p>A click with the right mouse button on the diagram brings up a context menu
    which consists of the following menu items:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Properties...</b><br>
        Edit several properties (colors, axes, etc.) of the diagram.<br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Edit24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Copy</b><br>
        Copies the diagram as image into the clipboard. <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Save As...</b><br>
        Save the diagram as image (PNG). <br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Export24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Print...</b><br>
        Print the diagram.<br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Print24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Zoom In</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Zoom in on both axes.<br>
                You can also zoom in by drawing a rectangle. Click at the top left corner of your desired zooming area,
                drag to the bottom right corner, and release. Note that this won't work when
                'Select Mask 'scatter_plot_area'' is selected.</li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Zoom in only on the domain axis.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Zoom in only on the range axis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Zoom Out</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Zoom out on both axes.<br></li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Zoom out only on the domain axis.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Zoom out only on the range axis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Auto Range</b><br>

            <li>Domain Axes - Adjusts the domain axis to the full data range.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Adjusts the range axis to the full data range.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Select Mask 'scatter_plot_area'</b><br>
        Allows you to create a mask from the scatter plot.
        After selecting the menu entry, you can choose an oval zone by clicking in the plot, dragging, and releasing.
        The mask will be selected immediately.
    </li>
    <li><b>Delete Mask 'scatter_plot_area'</b><br>
        Removes the mask 'scatter_plot_area' (in case you have created it before).
