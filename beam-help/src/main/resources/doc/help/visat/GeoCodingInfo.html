<h3>Geo-Coding Information</h3>

<p>This dialog, opened via <img src="images/icons/PhiLam24.gif">, shows the geo-coding information for the selected data
    product. Geo-coding enables VISAT to transform pixel co-odinates to geographical co-ordinates and vice versa.
    Geo-coding can be either based on a map projection (product is geo-referenced) or based on tie point grids
    (product is geo-coded). If a product is not geo-referenced, VISAT uses the tie point grids "latitude" and
    "longitude" for geo-coding.
</p>

<p>For tie point grid based geo-codings the transformation of a geographical co-ordinate to a pixel position is
    more complicated than the other way round. VISAT uses either an iterative algorithm or a polynomial approximation
    depending on the root mean square error (RMSE) of the approximation. If the RMSE is underneath half a pixel, the
    approximation is used instead of the iteration because the latter can sometimes have no clear attraction point and
    would yield to infinite looping.</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Note:</b> A mouse right-click within the geo-coding information area
    brings up a context menu with the item <i>Copy data to clipboard</i>.
    This will copy the diagram data as tabulated text to the system clipboard.
    The copied text can then be pasted directly into a spreadsheet application
    (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel).</p>
