<h3>Reprojection Dialog</h3>

<p>
    Here the use can create new product with a projected Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
    If you want that the created product is also orthorectified use the
    <a href="Orthorectification.html">Orthorectification</a> command.
    If its your intention to create one product from multiple input products use the
    <a href="Mosaic.html">Mosaic Processor</a>.

<p>
    After the new product has been created, you can change to VISAT's
    <a href="ProductBrowser.html">Product Browser</a> in order to open
    an <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a> for a band of the new product.

<h4>I/O Parameters</h4>

            <h5>Source Product</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Name:</b>
                Here the user specifies the name of the source product. The combo box presents
                a list of all products open in VISAT. The user may select one of these
                or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
                from the file system.

            <h5>Target Product</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Name:</b>
                Used to specify the name of the target product.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Save as:</b>
                Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
                combo box presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF, and HDF5.
                The text field allows to specify a target directory.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Open in VISAT:</b>
                Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the
                the target product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.

<h4>Projection Parameters</h4>
<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width:0;" valign="top">
            <h5>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Custom CRS:</b>
                The transformation used by the projection can be selected. Also the geodetic datum and
                transformation parameters can be set, if possible for the selected transformation.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Predefined CRS:</b>
                By clicking on the <b>Select...</b> button a new <a href="SelectCrsDialog.html">Select Coordinate Reference System</a> dialog is shown
                where a predefined CRS can be selected.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Use CRS of:</b>
                A product can be selected to use its projected Coordinate Reference System. This will have the effect
                that source product will cover the same geographic region on the same CRS. Which means that both
                products are collocated.
            </p>

            <h5>Output Settings</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Preserve resolution:</b>
                If unchecked the <b>Output Parameters...</b> is enabled and the upcoming
                <a href="ReprojectionOutputParametersDialog.html">Output Parameters</a> dialog lets you edit the output parameters like
                easting and northing of the reference pixel, the pixel size and the scene height and width.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Reproject tie-point grids:</b>
                Specifies whether or not the tie-point grids shall be included. If they are reprojected they will appear
                as bands in the target product and not any more as tie-point grids.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b> Add delta lat/lon bands:</b>
                Specifies whether or not delta latitude and longitude bands will be added to the target product.
                These are virtual bands, which can be used to assess the accuracy of the new geo-coding given
                by the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) with respect to the old geo-coding.
            </p>


            <p class="i1">
                <b>No-data value:</b>
                The default no-data value is used for output pixels in the projected band which have either no
                corresponding pixel in the source product or the source pixel is invalid.
            </p>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Resampling Method:</b>
                You can select one resampling method for the projection.<br>
                For a brief description have a look at <a href="../general/ResamplingMethods.html">Resampling
                Methods</a>.
            </p>

            <h5>Output Information</h5>

            <p class="i1">
                Displays some information about the output, like scene width and height, the geographic coordinate of
                the scene center and short description of the selected CRS.<br>
                When clicking the <b>Show WKT...</b> button the corresponding Well-Known Text of the currently defined
                CRS is shown.
