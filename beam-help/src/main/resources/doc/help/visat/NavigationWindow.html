<p> The Navigation Window is used to move the viewport of an
    <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a>, to zoom in and out of it and to rotate the image
    in steps of 5 degrees using the spinner control below the image preview.
    The current viewport is depicted by a semi-transparent rectangle which can be
    dragged in order to move the viewport to another location.
    It also provides a slider used to zoom in and out of the view:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/NavigationWindow.png"></p>


<p> The text box at the left side of slider can be used to adjust the zoom factor manually.
    You can enter decimal value which sets the zoom factor of the view to this value.
    Also you can enter the zoom factor in the same format as it is displayed.<br/>
    The Navigation window additionally provides the following features via its tool buttons:
</p>

<p> <a name="zoomin"><img src="images/icons/ZoomIn24.gif"></a>
    <b>Zoom In:</b>
    Zooms in by a factor of 1.2.</p>

<p> <a name="zoomout"><img src="images/icons/ZoomOut24.gif"></a>
    <b>Zoom Out:</b>
    Zooms out by a factor of 1/1.2.</p>

<p> <a name="zoomzero"><img src="images/icons/ZoomPixel24.gif"></a>
    <b>Zoom Actual Pixel:</b>
    Sets the zoom factor to the default value so that the size of an image pixel has
    the same size of a display pixel.</p>

<p> <a name="zoomall"><img src="images/icons/ZoomAll24.gif"></a>
    <b>Zoom All:</b>
    Adjusts the viewport to cover the entire image.</p>

<p> <a name="synchronise"><img src="images/icons/SyncViews24.png"></a>
    <b>Synchronise Views:</b>
    Synchronises the viewports of all compatible image views.</p>

<p> <a name="synchroniseCursor"><img src="images/icons/SyncCursor24.png"></a>
    <b>Synchronise Cursor:</b>
    Displays a synchronised cursor on all opened image views.</p>

<p> The following image shows VISAT with four image views that have been arranged with the
    <b>Tile Evenly</b> command of the <b>Window</b> menu. With synchronisation enabled,
    all image views use the same viewport:</p>
