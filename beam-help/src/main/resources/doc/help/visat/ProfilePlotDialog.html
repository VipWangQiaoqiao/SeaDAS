<h3>Profile Plot</h3>

<p>This option is available only if vector data is present in the product. Then, the profile plot may operate in two
    modes, the classic mode relying on a geometric shape, and the correlative mode which allows the user to compare
    satellite data to in-situ data. Both modes are thoroughly described below.
</p>

<h4>Profile plot for geometric shapes</h4>

<div class="image">
    <img src="images/ProfilePlotDialog.png" alt="profile_plot">
</div>

<p>
    The screenshot above displays how the profile plot works for geometries: the values on the x-axis are given by the path
    length,
    that is, for a path containing 300 pixels there are 300 x-values. The domain axis is determined by the currently
    selected band. The plot displays the value of the currently selected band along the bounds of a geometry; in case of
    the screenshot, the values of <i>algal_2</i> along a transect are displayed.
</p>

<h5>Standard deviation</h5>

<p>
    The blue shade around the plot line indicates the standard deviation of the selected band pixel within a square box.
    The
    edge length of that square box can be set to any odd value between 1 and 101.
</p>

<h5>Synchronise cursor position</h5>

<p>
    The profile plot can be run in a mode that allows the user to map the current position within the band image to the
    position within the plot. This mode is entered when the user clicks into the plot, and left when the user clicks
    into the tool window, but somewhere outside the plot. In the upper screenshot, the current position within the image is at
    pixel #178 of the transect, where the value of <i>algal_2</i> is 3.519.
</p>

<h4>Profile plot for correlative data</h4>


<div class="image">
    <img src="images/ProfilePlotDialog_correlative.png" alt="profile_plot">
</div>

<p>
    The screenshot displays the other features the profile plot offers. Note that there are some different tunings of the
    dialog: Most importantly, correlative data is being used. Additionally a ROI mask is being used, no in-between
    points are computed, and segments are marked. These features are described below separately.
</p>

<h5>Correlative data</h5>

<p>
    Using correlative data means that vector data may be displayed within the plot in order to make satellite data
    comparable to external data. When the option is chosen, some vector data source may be chosen from the 'Point data
    source'  dropdown list, and if it contains numerical data, the source for the numerical data may be chosen from the
    'Data field' dropdown list. After that, two plots are displayed in the chart: the first one (in the lower screenshot, it's
    the blue one) displays the values of the selected band at each pixel given by the vector data, while the second one
    (screenshot: the red one) displays the values of the selected data field.<br/>
</p>

<h5>ROI mask</h5>

<p>
    A ROI mask may be used to mask out values from the profile. All values which do not match the mask are not taken
    into account. In the example of the lower screenshot, only pixels that match the mask <i>water</i> are considered. For
    convenience, the mask manager may be openened from the profile plot window using the
    <img src="images/icons/MaskManager24.png">-button.
</p>

<h5>Compute in-between points</h5>

<p>
    When the checkbox 'Compute in-between points' is marked, the points the satellite data plot contains are connected.
    For each pixel of the geometry the value appears in the plot if the checkbox is marked, whereas only the
    end-points of the geometry are considered if the checkbox is not marked.<br/>
    Note that now the standard deviation is no more painted as blue shade around the plot line but as error bars around
    the points in the plot.<br/>
    The checkbox has no effect on the display of correlative data.
</p>

<h5>Mark segments</h5>

<p>
    When the checkbox 'Mark segments' is active, the different segments in which the considered geometry can be
    decomposed are marked by shades in the background of the plot. See the lower screenshot for an example.
</p>

<h5>Table view</h5>

<p>
    When you click <img src="images/icons/Table24.png"> you can switch to a <a href="TableView.html">table view</a> which provides information about the data displayed in the plot.
    From there, you will be able to switch back to the profile plot.
</p>

<h4>Context Menu</h4>

<p>A click with the right mouse button on the diagram brings up a context menu
    which consists of the following menu items:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Properties...</b><br>
        Edit several properties (colors, axes, etc.) of the diagram.<br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Edit24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Save As...</b><br>
        Save the diagram as image (PNG). <br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Export24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Copy</b><br>
        Copies the diagram as image into the clipboard. <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Print...</b><br>
        Print the diagram.<br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Print24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Zoom In</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Zoom in on both axes.</li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Zoom in only on the domain axis.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Zoom in only on the range axis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Zoom Out</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Zoom out on both axes.</li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Zoom out only on the domain axis.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Zoom out only on the range axis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Auto Range</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Adjusts both axes to the full data range.<br>
                You can also use the <img src="images/icons/View-Fullscreen22.png">-button
                on the right 'Plot' panel.
            </li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Adjusts the domain axis to the full data range.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Adjusts the range axis to the full data range.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Select Mask 'profile plot area'</b><br/>
        Switches on and off the mode in which a mask can be created from the profile plot. If the mode is active,
        ranges may be selected in the plot, which then appear as new mask 'profile plot area' within the mask manager.
    </li>
    <li><b>Delete Mask 'profile plot area'</b><br/>
        If the 'profile plot area' mask has been created before, it may be deleted using this command.
    </li>
    <li><b>Copy Data to Clipboard</b><br>
        This will copy the diagram data as tabulated text to the system clipboard.
        The copied text can then be pasted directly into a spreadsheet application
        (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel).
    </li>
</ul>
