<h3>Correlative Plot Display</h3>

<p>
    This dialog allows you to plot an imported variable (e.g. a ship track) against a raster variable.
    In order to plot them, these variables must be already imported into the product which contains the
    correlative raster data.<br/>
    You can select an existing or new defined ROI mask to filter which data should be displayed at the plot.<br/>
    (e.g. if you select a water mask, only as water classified raster data are displayed correlative with
    the imported data.)
</p>

<h4>Options Panel</h4>

<p>
    You can Collapse/Expand the options panel by cklicking to the button
    <img src="images/icons/PanelRight12.png" border="1"> or <img src="images/icons/PanelLeft12.png" border="1">
    at the top right place on the correlative plot display.
</p>

<p>
    The outcome of the correlative plot can be altered via the options in the options panel.<br>
</p>

<ul>

    <li><b>Refresh View <img src="images/icons/ViewRefresh22.png"></b><br>
        This button is disabled, because it is not needed at the correlative plot. If any value at the options panel
        has changed, the plot will automatically be recomputed.
    </li>

    <li><b>Table View</b> &nbsp;<img src="images/icons/Table24.png"><br>
        Shows the calculated data of the plot in a <a href="TableView.html">Table View</a> which provides
        information about the data displayed in the plot. From there, you will be able to switch back to
        the correlative plot.
    </li>

    <li><b>ROI Mask</b><br>
        A ROI mask may be used to mask out values. All values which do not match the mask are
        not taken
        into account. For convenience, the mask manager may be openened from the correlative plot
        window using the
        <img src="images/icons/MaskManager24.png">-button.<br>
    </li>

    <li><b>Box Size (Standard deviation)</b><br>
        The error bars, as you can see in the image above, indicate the standard
        deviation (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#With_sample_standard_deviation)
        of the correlative raster pixel within a square box. The edge length
        of that square box can be set to any odd value between 1 and 101.
        The selected raster variable is either the one currently selected in
        the <a href="ProductBrowser.html">Product View</a> or the currently selected
        <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a>.
    </li>

    <li><b>Point Data Source</b><br>
        At this place you have to select the imported reference data. Reference data can be
        imported in several ways.
        See import of <a href="ImportCSV.html">CSV data</a>, <a href="ImportShapefile.html">ESRI Shapefiles</a>,
        <a href="ImportMermaid.html">MERMAID Extraction Files</a> and
        <a href="ImportSeaDASTrack.html">SeaDAS Ship Tracks</a>.
    </li>

    <li><b>Data Field</b><br>
        Select the reference data, which should be displayed correlative to the selected
        raster variable.
    </li>

    <li><b>X-Axis</b> (Reference axis)<br>
        Reference values are assigned along the x-axis. If a reference data column is selected,
        the name of the selected reference data field is displayed in the header-line of the
        x-axis area.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auto min/max</b><br>
                You can explicitly set the minimum and maximum values to be considered during
                the computation of the correlative plot. To do so, uncheck the checkbox and
                enter the desired min- or max-value. When the checkboxes is checked , min-
                and max-values will be determined automatically.
            </li>
            <li><b>Log10 Scaled</b><br>
                Causes the x-axis to be log10 scaled.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Y-Axis</b> (Raster axis)<br>
        Raster values are assigned along the y-axis. If a raster value is selected, the name
        of the selected raster value is displayed in the header-line of the y-axis area.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auto min/max</b><br>
                You can explicitly set the minimum and maximum values to be considered during
                the computation of the correlative plot. To do so, uncheck the checkbox and
                enter the desired min- or max-value. When the checkboxes is checked , min-
                and max-values will be determined automatically.
            </li>
            <li><b>Log10 Scaled</b><br>
                Causes the y-axis to be log10 scaled.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Show Tolerance Range</b><br>
        Shows the user defined tolerance range as a blue shade along the 1:1 line. The tolerance range is only a
        visualisation tool, which causes no effects to computation.
    </li>

    <li><b>Show Regression Line</b><br>
        Displays a regression line which has been calculated with the ordinary least squares method
        (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares).
        Also the coefficient of determination (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination)
        and the linear equation are displayed in the plot.
    </li>

    <li><b>Zoom all <img src="images/icons/View-Fullscreen22.png"></b><br>
        Adjusts both axes to the full data range.
        You can also use the 'Auto range' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Edit Properties <img src="images/icons/Edit24.gif"></b><br>
        Edit several properties (colors, axes, etc.) of the diagram.
        You can also use the 'Properties...' entry in the context menu.
