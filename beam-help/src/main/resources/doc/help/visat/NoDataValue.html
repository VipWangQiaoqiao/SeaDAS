<h3>No-Data Value</h3>

<p>Band or tie point grids of a data product determine by two means whether or not a pixel at a certain position
    contains data:
    <ld>
        <li>a no-data value and/or</li>
        <li>a valid pixel expression is set.</li>
    </ld>
    These properties can be adjusted using the <a href="PropertyEditor.html">Property Editor</a>. If valid pixel
    detection is
    enabled, invalid pixels are excluded from range, histogram and other statistical computations.
    In order to visualise the invalid pixel positions, the <a href="NoDataOverlay.html">No-Data Overlay</a> is used.
</p>

<p>The no-data property of a band is also set by the <a href="BandMaths.html">Band Maths</a>
    and <a href="Reprojection.html">Reprojection</a> tools.
