<h3>Histogram Display</h3>

<p>
    This dialog allows for the display of a histogram for the selected band.<br>
    The value range is evenly divided into bins.
    The histogram shows how many pixels of the image fall into each of the bins.<br>
    It is computed when you hit <img src="images/icons/ViewRefresh22.png">.
</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/HistogramDialog.png"></div>
<br>

<h4>Options Panel</h4>

<p>
    In the panel to the right you find several options to alter the outcome of the histogram.
    Note that the histogram needs to be recomputed in order for changes to the option panel to take effect.
</p>

<ul>

    <li><b>Refresh View <img src="images/icons/ViewRefresh22.png"></b><br>
        Causes the histogram to be (re-)computed.
        The button is only enabled when a computation is expected to lead to a different histogram than the one on display.
    </li>

    <li><b>Collapse/Expand Options Panel <img src="images/icons/PanelRight12.png" border="1" > / <img src="images/icons/PanelLeft12.png" border="1"></b><br>
        Collapses or expands the options panel.
    </li>

    <li><b>ROI Mask</b><br>
        A ROI mask may be used to mask out values. All values which do not match the mask are not taken
        into account. For convenience, the mask manager may be openened from the histogram window using the
        <img src="images/icons/MaskManager24.png">-button.<br>
        For creating a ROI mask from the histogram, see 'Select Mask 'histogram_plot_area'' from the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Bins</b><br>
        The number of bins can be explicitly set.
        The bins will be evenly distributed in the defined value range.
    </li>

    <li><b>Log10 scaled values</b><br>
        When this option is enabled, not the band values themselves but their common logarithms will be considered during
        the computation.
        This option will be disabled when the band contains no positive values.
    </li>

    <li><b>Auto min/max</b><br>
        When enabled, the minimum and maximum band value to be considered during the computation of the histogram are
        determined automatically.
        When disabled, you can set these values yourself.
    </li>

    <li><b>Log10 scaled</b><br>
        Causes the x-axis to be log10-scaled.
        No new histogram will be computed.
        This option will be disabled when the band contains at least one negative value or when the displayed histogram was
        created with log10 scaled values.
    </li>

    <li><b>Zoom all <img src="images/icons/View-Fullscreen22.png"></b><br>
        Adjusts both axes to the full data range.
        You can also use the 'Auto range' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Edit Properties <img src="images/icons/Edit24.gif"></b><br>
        Edit several properties (colors, axes, etc.) of the diagram.
        You can also use the 'Properties...' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Save chart as image <img src="images/icons/Export24.gif"></b><br>
        Save the diagram as image (PNG).
        You can also use the 'Save as...' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Print chart <img src="images/icons/Print24.gif"></b><br>
        Print the diagram.
        You can also use the 'Print...' entry in the context menu.
    </li>

    <li><b>Help <img src="images/icons/Help22.png"></b><br>
        Displays this page.
    </li>

</ul>

<h4>Context Menu</h4>

<p>A click with the right mouse button on the diagram brings up a context menu
    which consists of the following menu items:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Properties...</b><br>
        Edit several properties (colors, axes, etc.) of the diagram.<br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Edit24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Copy</b><br>
        Copies the diagram as image into the clipboard.<br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Save As...</b><br>
        Save the diagram as image (PNG). <br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Export24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Print...</b><br>
        Print the diagram.<br>
        You can also use the <img src="images/icons/Print24.gif"> on the right 'Plot' panel.
    </li>
    <li><b>Zoom In</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Zoom in on both axes.<br></li>
            You can also zoom in by drawing a rectangle. Click at the top left corner of your desired zooming area,
            drag to the bottom right corner, and release. Note that this won't work when
            'Select Mask 'histogram_plot_area'' is selected.
            <li>Domain Axes - Zoom in only on the domain axis.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Zoom in only on the range axis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Zoom Out</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Zoom out on both axes.<br></li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Zoom out only on the domain axis.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Zoom out only on the range axis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Auto Range</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Both Axes - Adjusts both axes to the full data range.<br>
                You can also use the <img src="images/icons/View-Fullscreen22.png"> on the right 'Plot' panel.</li>
            <li>Domain Axes - Adjusts the domain axis to the full data range.</li>
            <li>Range Axes - Adjusts the range axis to the full data range.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Select Mask 'histogram_plot_area'</b><br>
        Allows you to create a mask from the histogram.
        After selecting the menu entry, you can choose a horizontal range in the histogram by clicking at one end of
        the range, dragging the mouse to the other end, and releasing.
        The mask will be selected immediately.
    </li>
    <li><b>Delete Mask 'histogram_plot_area'</b><br>
        Removes the mask 'histogram_plot_area' (in case you have created it before).
    </li>
    <li><b>Copy Data to Clipboard</b><br>
        This will copy the diagram data as tabulated text to the system clipboard.
        The copied text can then be pasted directly into a spreadsheet application
        (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel).
