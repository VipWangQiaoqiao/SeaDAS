<h2>Import ESRI Shapefile</h2>

<p>When importing an ESRI Shapefile and no associated <b>*.prj</b> is found, you will be asked to
    define the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) on which is coordinates of the shapefile are defined.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ImportShapefileDefineCRS.png">
</p>

<p>
    You can choose between three options to define the CRS:
<ul>
    <li><b>Use target CRS</b><br/>
        This options can be chosen if the shapefile is defined on the same CRS as the product you want
        to import the shapefile. The transformation used by the projection can be selected. Also the geodetic
        datum and transformation parameters can be set, if possible for the selected transformation.
    </li>
    <li><b>Custom CRS</b><br/>
        Here you can freely define the CRS of the shapefile.
    </li>
    <li><b>Predefined CRS</b><br/>
        By clicking on the <b>Select...</b> button a new <a href="SelectCrsDialog.html">Select Coordinate Reference System</a> dialog is shown
        where a predefined CRS can be selected.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="askIfSeparateGeometries"/>Display the Shapes</h3>

<p>
    After the CRS of the shape data has been selected and confirmed with 'OK', a new dialog 'Import Geometry' is
    shown in case if the shapefile contains more than one single geometry.
    It can now be selected if these geometries shall be imported separately or as a whole.

    Also, the attribute for the mask/layer naming can be selected from a drop-down box.
