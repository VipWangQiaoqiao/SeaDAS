<h3>Product/Band Information</h3>

<p>This dialog, opened via <img src="images/icons/NodeInfo24.png">, shows general properties of a loaded product,
    band or tie-point grid and their parent product.
</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Note:</b> A mouse right-click within the properties data area
    brings up a context menu with the item <i>Copy data to clipboard</i>.
    This will copy the diagram data as tabulated text to the system clipboard.
    The copied text can then be pasted directly into a spreadsheet application
    (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel).</p>
