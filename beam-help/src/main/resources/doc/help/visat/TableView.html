<h3>Table View</h3>

<p>
    A table view can be accessed from the <a href="CorrelativePlotDialog.html">Correlative Plot</a> or the <a
        href="ProfilePlotDialog.html">Profile Plot</a>.
    It refers to the data used to create the according plot and the selected band.<br>
    You can switch back to the chart view by clicking the chart icon in the upper right.
    The screenshot below shows the table view for a correlative plot.
</p>

<blockquote><img src="images/CoordinateListDialog.png">
</blockquote>

<p>
    Note the following rules:
    For the correlative plot, only those pixels which contain points are considered.
    For the profile plot, also pixels between pixels containing vector points are considered (you can disable this
    by deselecting 'Compute in-between points' in the chart view).
    Incoming reference data are marked with the suffix "_ref" which means reference data.
</p>

<p>
    In detail, the view lists:
</p>

<ul>

    <li>
        The pixel index
    </li>

    <li>
        The pixel's image coordinates
    </li>

    <li>
        The pixel's geographic coordinates
    </li>

    <li>
        The arithmetic mean (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of the valid pixels' values within the box set in the chart view
    </li>

    <li>
        The pixel sigma, which indicates the standard deviation (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#With_sample_standard_deviation)
        within the box set in the chart view
    </li>

    <li>
        The selected data field (e.g. chl) of the correlative data (only if there is correlative data available for the
        pixel)
    </li>

    <li>
        All the other data field values according to the current correlative data
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
    A mouse right-click within the table brings up a context menu with the item <i>Copy data to clipboard</i>.
    This will copy the diagram data as tabulated text to the system clipboard.
    The copied text can then be pasted directly into a spreadsheet application (e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel).
