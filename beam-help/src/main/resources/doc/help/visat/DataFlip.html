<h3>Data Flip (Product Transposition)</h3>

<p>The data-flip-command applies a flip operation to an input product and creates
    a new transposed output product.</p>

<p>After the new product has been created, you can change to VISAT's
    <a href="ProductBrowser.html">Product Browser</a> in order to open an image view for
    a band of the new product.</p>


<p align="center"><img src="images/DataFlip.jpg" width="454" height="319"></p>

<h4>Input Product:</h4>

<p>You must specify an input product here. Note that this command operates on
    entire products, so you might want to create a product subset first.</p>

<h4>Output Product</h4>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    You can specify the output product's name here. Though not required, best practice is to specify a name which is
    unique within VISAT's open product list.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Description:</b>
    You can enter a short description text for the new product here.</p>

<h4>Flip Data</h4>

<p class="i1">
    <b>horizontally</b> radiobutton<br>
    Mirrors the tie-point grids and bands of the product along the central, vertical axis.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>vertically</b> radiobutton<br>
    Mirrors the tie-point grids and bands of the product along the central, horizontal axis.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>horizontally &amp; vertically</b> radiobutton<br>
    Mirrors the tie-point grids and bands of the product along both, the central, vertical and
    horizontal axes.
</p>

<h4>Output product Information</h4>

<p>Displays properties for the resulting output product.</p>

<h4>OK Button</h4>

<p> Applies the flip transposition to the input product, creates the specified
    output product and closes the dialog. </p>
