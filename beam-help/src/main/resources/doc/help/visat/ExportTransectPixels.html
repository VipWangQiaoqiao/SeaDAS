<h3>Export Transect Pixels </h3>

<p>This command allows the export of pixel values along the current transect as tab-separated values. This is convenient
    for further use in spreadsheets, e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel.
    A transect can be defined by arbitrary shape figures drawn into an image. You can also re-import a transect
    which was exported earlier as text/CSV file (see below) or <a href="ExportShapefile.html">exported as shapefile</a>.
    Please refer to import of <a href="ImportCSV.html">CSV data</a> and <a href="ImportShapefile.html">shapefiles.</a>
</p>

<p>The command is similar to <a href="ExportMaskPixels.html">Export Mask Pixels</a>, and also the export format is
    identical.
</p>

<p>The &quot;Copy to Clipboard&quot; option will copy the transect pixel values to the clipboard. This may take a few
    moments, depending on the amount of pixels.</p>

<p>The &quot;Write to File&quot; option brings up a file chooser dialog to select the destination directory and to
    assign a name to the text file (CSV format). The written file may easily be imported with any text editor or spreadsheet
    software. </p>

<p class="inote">Note: im low memory situations it may be a better idea to export to a file instead of copying to the
    clipboard.</p>
