<h3>VISAT's File Menu</h3>


<h4><a name="new">New Product&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/New24.gif"></a></h4>

<p>The new-command allows you to create a new product. The command is enabled only if you have
    already opened or imported a product from which the new product can derive it's geo-coding information.
    The primary use of this command is to create a <a href="ProductSubsetDialog.html">spectral or spatial subset</a> of
    another, open product.</p>


<h4><a name="open">Open Product (Control-O)&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/Open24.gif"></a></h4>

<p>Opens one or multiple data products stored on the hard disk in VISAT. You can select more than one product, e.g. by
    pressing the <b>CTRL</b> and select the desired products with the mouse.</p>

<h4><a name="openSession">Open Session (Control-Shift-O)</a></h4>

<p>Opens a BEAM <a href="Session.html">Session</a> file stored on the hard disk in VISAT. A session is termed the
    collection of all products and image views open in VISAT, including any layers added to a view. When a session
    file is opened, a previously saved session (see <a href="#saveSession">Save Session</a>) is restored.
    Note that all open products will be closed before a session file is opened.
</p>

<h4>Reopen&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/History24.gif"></h4>

<p>VISAT stores the location of files previously opened or saved in this menu group. Select
    an entry and VISAT will re-open the product.</p>

<h4>Product Grabber&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/RsProduct16.gif"></h4>

<p>Opens the <a href="../visat/ProductGrabber.html">Product Grabber</a> for data product previewing, opening or
    importing
    reasons.</p>

<h4><a name="close">Close Product (Control-W)</a></h4>

<p>Closes the currently selected product. This commands is also available in the
    context menu when you right-click over the open product list.</p>

<h4><a name="closeSession">Close Session (Control-Shift-W)</a></h4>

<p>Closes all products and image views currently open in VISAT. Note that changes made during a session are not written
    to an associated BEAM <a href="Session.html">Session</a> file. In order to write the changes to a session file the
    session must be saved (see <a href="#saveSession">Save Session</a>) explicitly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4><a name="save">Save Product (Control-S)&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/Save24.gif"></a></h4>

<p>Saves the currently selected product in the <a href="../general/BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP format</a>.
    If the product still does not have a file location, then you are asked to specify a storage location for the
    product. Note that save process can be a time consuming process for huge products.</p>

<h4>Save Product As&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/icons/SaveAs24.gif"></h4>

<p>Saves the currently selected product to a different location. You are asked to specify a new storage location
    for the selected product.</p>

<h4><a name="saveSession">Save Session (Control-Shift-S)</a></h4>

<p>Saves the current <a href="Session.html">Session</a> to the associated BEAM session file. If the current session is
    not associated with a BEAM session file, you are asked to specify a storage location for the session file.</p>
