<h2>Export CSV Data</h2>

<p>
    BEAM/Visat supports the export of raster data as CSV ('Character Separated Value') data into plain text files.
    To invoke this export, choose the item 'Export Raster Data' --> 'CSV' from the BEAM/Visat 'File' menu.
    A file chooser dialog will be displayed to select an export file (extension .csv).
    By default, all bands, tie point grids and metadata sets will be exported to the CSV file (row by row from top to
    bottom of the product raster, each row from left to right. Each pixel is represented by one line in the CSV
    file, each quantity by one column. An additional column with the 'featureId' (which is just an ascending pixel
    counter) is put in front. Also, the file contains a header line with the names and data types for each column
    (name and data type separated by ':'). The column separator is the 'tab' character. See example below.

<h4>Export of Data Subsets</h4>
<p>
    CSV exports of a whole product would usually become very large. Therefore, the export functionality offers
    the opportunity to define subsets: either spatial subsets, or subsets by choosing only distinct bands,
    tie point grids or metadata items. To define the subset to be exported, click the 'Subset...'-button in the
    upper right of the export file chooser dialog. The <a href="ProductSubsetDialog.html">Specify Product Subset</a>
    dialog will be opened for subset specification.
