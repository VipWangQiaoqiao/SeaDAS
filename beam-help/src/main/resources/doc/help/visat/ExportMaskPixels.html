<h3>Export Mask pixels </h3>

<p>This command allows the export of pixel values as tab-separated values. This is convenient for further use in
    spreadsheets, e.g. Microsoft&reg; Excel. When selected, a dialog box pops up:
</p>

<p><img src="images/ExportMaskPixels.jpg" width="335" height="121"></p>

<p>The command is similar to <a href="ExportTransectPixels.html">Export Transect pixels</a> and also the export format
    is identical.
</p>

<p>The &quot;Copy to Clipboard&quot; option will copy the mask pixel values to the clipboard. This may take a few
    moments, depending on the amount of pixels.</p>

<p>The &quot;Write to File&quot; option brings up a file chooser dialog to select the destination directory and to
    assign a name to the text file. The written file may easily be imported with any text editor or spreadsheet
    software. </p>

<p class="inote">Note: im low memory situations it may be a better idea to export to a file instead of copying to the
    clipboard.</p>
