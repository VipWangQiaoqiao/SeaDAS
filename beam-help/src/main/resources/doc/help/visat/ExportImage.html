<h3>Export View as Image</h3>

<p>This command allows the export of the displayed image of the active <a href="ProductSceneView.html">Image View</a> to
    an image file.</p>

<p>
    The save image dialog offers the possibility to choose whether the visible region or the full scene should be
    exported. The exported image exhibits all layers that are visible in the Image View.
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to specify the dimension of the exported image, i.e. its width and height in pixels. Note that the
    aspect ratio of the exported image will always be the same as the aspect ratio of the Image View or the aspect ratio
    of the full scene, depending on the selected image region. Also note that the dimension of the exported image may be
    larger or smaller than the dimension of the image displayed in the Image View.
</p>

<p>
    The dimension of the exported image is constrained by the amount of available memory. When exporting the image might
    fail because the memory required by the exported image comes close to the amount of available memory a warning
    message is displayed. Nevertheless, exporting the image may succeed. An error message is displayed when the image
    export has actually failed. In this case either increase the amount of available memory or reduce the dimension of
    the exported image.
</p>
<p> The supported image formats are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>BMP: Microsoft Windows Bitmap (*.bmp)</li>
    <li>PNG: Portable Network Graphics (*.png)</li>
    <li>JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group (*.jpg, *.jpeg)</li>
    <li>TIFF: Tagged Image File Format (*.tif, *.tiff)</li>
    <li>GeoTIFF: TIFF with geo-location (*.tif, *.tiff)</li>
</ul>
