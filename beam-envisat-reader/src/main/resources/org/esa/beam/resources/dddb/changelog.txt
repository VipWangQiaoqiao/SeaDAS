This is the CHANGELOG file for the ENVISAT Data Description Database (DDDB)
as part of the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox.

==========================================================================
 Changes in Version 0.5
==========================================================================


2001/12/04

Initial version obtained from Olivier Colin at ESA/ESRIN. The database was
called ENVISAT Data Dictionary.


2002/01/07

All files not related to the ENVISAT products considered in the MA-Toolbox
have been removed. This was done in order to reduce the effort of changing
the database format to suit the needs of the MA-Toolbox software components.
These are the remaining product types:
ASA_APG_1P.dd ASA_APM_1P.dd ASA_APP_1P.dd ASA_APS_1P.dd ASA_GM1_1P.dd
ASA_IMG_1P.dd ASA_IMM_1P.dd ASA_IMP_1P.dd ASA_IMS_1P.dd ASA_WSM_1P.dd
ASA_WVI_1P.dd ASA_WVS_1P.dd ASA_WVW_2P.dd
ATS_AR__2P.dd ATS_MET_2P.dd ATS_NL__0P.dd ATS_NR__2P.dd ATS_TOA_1P.dd
MER_FR__1P.dd MER_FR__2P.dd MER_LRC_2P.dd MER_RRC_2P.dd MER_RRV_2P.dd
MER_RR__1P.dd MER_RR__2P.dd
