<h3>The user interface</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters</h4>

<p>
    Using the I/O Parameters tab, the input products can be set, as well as the target product's name and target
    directory.
    See the screenshot below.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="images/ui_io_parameters.png">
</p>

<p>
    When the Run-button is clicked, the binning is performed according to the preferences that are specified in the
    "Filter-" and the "Configuration"-tabs.
</p>

<h4>Filter</h4>

<p>
    Two filters can be applied to limit the contents of the target product. See the screenshot below for the user
    interface for the filters.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h5>Specify target region</h5>

<p>
    The target region filter can be used to set the bounds of the target product. It is able to operate in four
    different modes:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        the bounds of the target product are inferred by the bounds of all inputs products; that is, the smallest
        rectangular bounding box that contains all input products is being used.
    </li>
    <li>
        the whole globe is used as region for the target product
    </li>
    <li>
        the bounds of the target product are given by a user-provided WKT, according to this
        <a href="http://docs.geotools.org/stable/javadocs/org/opengis/referencing/doc-files/WKT.html">specification</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        the region of the target product can be drawn and entered using a dedicated world map component
    </li>
</ol>

<h5>
    Specify temporal filtering
</h5>

<p>
    The method that is used to decide which source pixels are used with respect to their observation time.
<ul>
    <li>NONE: ignore pixel observation time, use all source pixels.
    <li>TIME_RANGE: use all pixels that have been acquired in the given binning period.
    <li>SPATIOTEMPORAL_DATADAY: use a sensor-dependent, spatial "data-day" definition with the goal to minimise the tim
        between the first and last observation contributing to the same bin in the given binning period.<br>
        The decision whether a source pixel contributes to a bin or not, is a function of the pixel's observation
        longitude
        and time<br>
        Requires the parameter 'minDataHour'.
</ul>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

The third tab allows the user to supply the general binning configuration. See the screenshot below for an example.

<p>
    <img src="images/ui_configuration.png">
</p>

<h5>The bands table</h5>

<p>
    Using the table, the user can specify the sources that shall be aggregated for the target product. Using the <i>plus</i> and
    <i>minus</i> buttons, sources (which can be any raster data, or expressions) can be added and removed.<br>
    The second column allows the user to set a target name for the aggregation; in case an expression is defined as
    source, setting a target name is mandatory.<br>
    The third column is used to set the aggregation method; depending on which aggregation method is chosen, a number of
    additional parameters must be set.<br>
    Table cells are edited via double click.
</p>

<h5>Valid expression and target height</h5>

<p>
    Using the valid expression, the user can specify which values in the source products shall be considered. Thus, a
    boolean expression has to be set here. In the configuration of the example screenshot, only pixels that are not over
    land are considered.<br>
    The target height of the source product may be set, too; this value has direct influence on the spatial resolution.
</p>

<h5>Supersampling</h5>

<p>
    As long as the area of an input pixel is small compared to the area of a bin,
    a simple binning is sufficient. In this case,
    the geodetic center coordinate of the Level 2 pixel is used
    to find the bin in the Level 3 grid whose area is intersected by this point.
    If the area of the contributing pixel is equal or even larger than the bin area,
    this simple binning will produce composites with insufficient accuracy and
    visual artifacts such as Moir&eacute; effects will dominate the resulting datasets.</p>

<p>
    The following figure illustrates this problem.</p>

<p>
    <img src="images/chessGrid.png">
</p>

<p><i>Level 2 grid (blue) and Level 3 grid (yellow)</i></p>

<p>The blue chessboard grid refers to the input data,
    the yellow one refers to the final Level 3 grid. As the figure clearly shows,
    single Level 2 pixels cannot be uniquely be assigned to single bins.</p>

<p>
    Supersampling parameter can be used to reduce or avoid the Moir&eacute; effect.
    The Moir&eacute; effect usually occurs when the spatial resolution used for the
    binning is similar to or smaller than the input pixel resolution. The supersampling
    subdivides every input pixel to n x n subpixels which all have the same values but
    different and unique geographical coordinates. This way, an input pixel may be
    distributed to more than one adjacent bin cell.
