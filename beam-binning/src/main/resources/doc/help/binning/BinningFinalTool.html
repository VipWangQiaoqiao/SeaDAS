<p>The L3 Final Processor converts a bin database to a final level 3 product by
    running a finalisation process on the accumulated bins (depending on the needs
    of the algorithm) and applying a projection (geographic lat/lon) to the binned
    data cells. </p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Bin-Database</b>: Select the location of the bin database by either typing
        the database path into the text filed or by pressing the file selection button
        <img src="images/FileDialogButton.png"> to invoke a
        standard file dialog.</li>
    <li><b>Output product file</b>: Select the output product file by either typing

    <li><b>Output product format</b>: Select one of the available output product
        formats. Currently only &quot;<a href="../../BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a>&quot;
        is available.</li>
    <li><b>Tailor output product to geographic boundaries of available data</b>: Enable
        this checkbox to tailor the geopraphic size of the output product to the area that really contains data.</li>
    <li><b>Delete Bin Database</b>: Select whether to delete the bin database after
        final product creation or to keep it (for further products to be added).</li>
    <li><b>Log filename prefix</b>: Select the prefix text used for the logfile
        written during processing. For a complete description of the logging capabilities
